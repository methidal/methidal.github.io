                Hey ! It’s tea time!
                How much is it? Should I pay a dime?
                I’ll have tulsi tea and one for my friend too,
                Come on friend, we shall also sit with you!
                Come on! I can’t wait!
                We gotta get home, it's getting late!
                We forgot one for papa!
                And one for mama!
                Then we will go to the shop
                Oh, my tea! Don’t let it drop!
                Come on in kids, I’ll open the door
                Hello sir ! About the tea, we want some more. 
                That you shall have, don’t make haste!
                Yes we all know haste makes waste!
                Can I tell you how many cups we need sir?
                Yes please tell me that for sure!
                Some delicious tea 
                Would be nice for me
                Said papa and mama back at home
                The evening light making their house like a tomb
                Well surely I know about your house!
                That little dark cottage wouldn’t hurt a mouse!
                It’s on that tiny cliff over there, you know that don’t you?
                Yes! I’m very sure I knew that too!
                Let’s take the tea L back to our family,
                They must be panting for even a tiny drop of tea!
                Let’s run back to the cliff!
                Let’s be there in a jiff
                The wolves are up
                And so are their pups!
                Now, we’ll take our tea back home
                Hey friend! Please don’t moan
                Now, now ! You don’t groan 
                The friends traveled all on their own
                They were back from that tea time
                Which didn’t even cost a dime!
