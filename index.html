            <p class="tea_time_paragraph">             
                Hey ! It’s tea time!<br>
                How much is it? Should I pay a dime?<br>
                I’ll have tulsi tea and one for my friend too,<br>
                Come on friend, we shall also sit with you!<br>
                Come on! I can’t wait!<br>
                We gotta get home, it's getting late!<br>
                We forgot one for papa!<br>
                And one for mama!<br>
                Then we will go to the shop<br>
                Oh, my tea! Don’t let it drop!<br>
                Come on in kids, I’ll open the door<br>
                Hello sir ! About the tea, we want some more.<br> 
                That you shall have, don’t make haste!<br>
                Yes we all know haste makes waste!<br>
                Can I tell you how many cups we need sir?<br>
                Yes please tell me that for sure!<br>
                Some delicious tea <br>
                Would be nice for me<br>
                Said papa and mama back at home<br>
                The evening light making their house like a tomb<br>
                Well surely I know about your house!<br>
                That little dark cottage wouldn’t hurt a mouse!<br>
                It’s on that tiny cliff over there, you know that don’t you?<br>
                Yes! I’m very sure I knew that too!<br>
                Let’s take the tea back to our family,<br>
                They must be panting for even a tiny drop of tea!<br>
                Let’s run back to the cliff!<br>
                Let’s be there in a jiff<br>
                The wolves are up<br>
                And so are their pups!<br>
                Now, we’ll take our tea back home<br>
                Hey friend! Please don’t moan<br>
                Now, now ! You don’t groan <br>
                The friends traveled all on their own<br>
                They were back from that tea time<br>
                Which didn’t even cost a dime!<br>

            <h3>Impossible things</h3>
            <p>
                Impossible things 
                Some impossible things to have in life<br>
                Is to have an amphibian for a wife<br><br>

                A faun shooting us with a rifle<br>
                An elephant eating a bite sized trifle<br><br>

                Where lions could eat<br>
                A chocolate for a treat<br><br>

                Bees constructing wooden  houses<br>
                And the plural of mouse was mouses!<br><br>

                Us humans could eat planets and galaxies for lunch<br>
                And if frogs could eat big whales for a wonderful brunch<br><br>

                Songs couldn’t be heard<br>
                And squirrels ate licorice and curd<br><br>

                So many wonderful tunes<br>
                Were embedded in golden dunes<br><br>

                If a snail could cook and use a dicer,<br>
                The not so good Earth would be so much nicer<br><br>

            <h3>Trees</h3>
            <p>
                Trees are great,<br>
                At a wonderful rate <br><br>

                In spring and summer she may bear<br>	
                Juicy fruits that could lure a mare<br><br>

                Her body pressed against the Earth<br>
                And to baby saplings she gives birth<br><br>

                Her arms waving in the Summer breeze<br>
                Though in Winter she may freeze<br><br>

                Like a bonnet in  sunny Spring,<br>
                Her dress is of flowers and saplings<br><br>

                 I like to watch her in sun and rain<br>
                ‘Cause she’s my friend in pain and gain<br><br>

            <h3>Candy</h3>
            <p>
                What’s this? It’s candy!<br>
                Is there some left for me?<br>
                And some for my family?<br><br>

                So much delight<br>
                In every single bite<br>
                And the candy store, what a sight!<br>
                Children everywhere!<br>
                For the others, do they even care?<br>
                The candy store ,<br>
                So much candy! So much more!<br><br>

                The parents exclaim “Hey, that candy was for me!”<br>
                From each and every family<br>
                They parade through the city<br>
                With that delicious candy<br><br>

                They’re not giving me anything<br>
                Every kid gets at least something!<br>
                It’s like the first day of spring<br>
                No, I’m seriously not kidding!<br><br>

            <h3>My Love for a Leaf</h3>
            <p>
                My love for my leaf is as gentle as a fern<br>
                Sometimes she may get angry and even turn<br><br>

                But her colors are distractingly pure<br>
                And how much does it lure <br><br>

                As she slips into sleep<br>
                Forever so deep<br><br>

                I cry for my friend in the heavens above <br>
                A little new flutters like a feather from a dove<br><br>
