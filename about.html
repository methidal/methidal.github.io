        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a dog loving, kind 9-year old that loves writing poems. I love writing about seasons the best, but I like writing all kinds of poems as well. I also like writing bio-poems.

            Bio-poems are poems that talk about other people. I like to write them really funny. That makes it more fun to read!
